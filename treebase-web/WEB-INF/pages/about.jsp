	<h1>Overview</h1>
	<p>
		TreeBASE is a relational database designed to manage and explore information on 
		phylogenetic relationships (Sanderson et al., 1993, 1994; Piel et al., 1996; 
		Morel, 1996; Piel et al., 2000). It includes phylogenetic trees and data 
		matrices, together with information about the relevant publication, taxa, 
		morphological and sequence-based characters, and published analyses. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The database is designed to allow retrieval of trees and data from different 
		studies so that existing phylogenetic results may be reassessed, compared, 
		combined and reused. Applications include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			to locate information on the phylogeny of particular groups of interest.
		</li>
		<li>
			to obtain datasets for studies of character evolution, including general 
			patterns across many groups, such as patterns of homoplasy.
		</li>
		<li>
			in studies of biogeography -- to retrieve trees with representatives in 
			particular geographical areas.
		</li>
		<li>
			in studies of coevolution -- to retrieve information on host and parasite 
			phylogenies.
		</li>
		<li>
			in studies of congruence and combination of data -- to retrieve all molecular 
			and morphological phylogenies for particular groups.
		</li>
		<li>
			in studies of phylogenetic methods -- to retrieve all parsimony or maximum 
			likelihood reconstructions, for example, or to download datasets of various 
			sorts to test methods.
		</li>
		<li>
			to link together trees of particular groups into more inclusive phylogenies.
		</li>
		<li>
			to discover understudied groups -- a resource for students, funding agencies, 
			etc.
		</li>
		<li>
			to retrieve phylogenetic information for use in conservation biology and the 
			management of natural resources.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>History, Funding, and Governance</h2>
	<p>
		The prototype for TreeBASE was first launched in 1994 (Sanderson et al. 1994, 
		Piel et al., 2002) with funding from NSF SGER (NSF DEB 9318325: "A prototype 
		database of phylogenetic studies").  The database underwent a complete 
		redevelopment and redesign with funding from the <a href="http://www.phylo.org">
		Cyberinfrastructure for Phylogenetic Research project</a> (NSF EF 0331654: 
		"Building the Tree of Life -- A National Resource for Phyloinformatics and 
		Computational Phylogenetics"). 
	</p>
	<p>
		TreeBASE was released in March 2010 as one of the main products of <a href="http://www.phylofoundation.org" title="Phyloinformatics Research Foundation, Inc.">The 
		Phyloinformatics Research Foundation, Inc.</a>, a Connecticut non-stock 
		corporation. The Foundation provides direction, governance, and continuity for 
		software, data sharing, and communication standards to promote phyloinformatic 
		research for the scientific community.
	</p>
	<p>
		The current version of the database is 2.0 (released March 2010), and is hosted 
		by the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (<a href="http://www.nescent.org">
		NESCent</a>). In previous years the database has been hosted by the 
		<a href="http://www.peabody.yale.edu/">Yale Peabody Museum</a>, the 
		<a href="http://www.sdsc.edu">San Diego Supercomputer Center</a>, the 
		<a href="http://www.buffalo.edu">University at Buffalo</a>, 
		<a href="http://www.harvard.edu">Harvard University</a>, 
		<a href="http://www.leiden.edu">Leiden University</a>, and the 
		<a href="http://www.ucdavid.edu">University of California, Davis</a>.
