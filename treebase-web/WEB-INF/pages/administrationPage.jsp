<p>Currently, administration page shows two menus available. First one, 'Study Management', allows administrator to view any user's
 studies/submissions, all the 'Ready State Studies, and Submission based on 'Submission ID'and change their status.
 To view user studies, one requires a valid user name and by default the selection goes to the user's 'Ready' state 
 studies. However, selection can be changed through the drop down to 'All', 'Published', or 'In Progress' studies. 
 For testing purposes, one could try own user name or alternately use 'z' without quotes as user name. </p>
 <br/>
 
 <p>Other menu 'User Management', provides tools to allow Administrator to change a user information, delete a user, and merge two users.</p>
