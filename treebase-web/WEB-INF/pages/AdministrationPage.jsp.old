<p>Currently, administration page has only two functional menus available. First one allows administrator to view any user's
 studies/submissions and change their status. It requires a valid user name and by default the selection goes to the user's 'Ready' state 
 studies. However, selection can be changed through the drop down to 'All', 'Published', or 'In Progess' studies. For testing purposes, one could try
 own user name or alternately use 'z' without quotes as user name. </p>
 <br/>
 
 <p>Other menu, currently shows all the the studies in the 'Ready' state and it is not interactive right now.</p>
