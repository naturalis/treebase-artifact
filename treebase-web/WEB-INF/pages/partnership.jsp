			title="Dryad">Dryad</a> is an open digital repository of author-submitted 
		published data which supports many journals in evolutionary biology and ecology.
		Metadata in TreeBASE is being harvested and mirrored by Dryad using the TreeBASE 
		OAI-PMH service. Metadata for existing TreeBASE records is being enriched through 
		manual and semi-automated mechanisms. Dryad is also forwarding phylogenetic data
		depositions to TreeBASE at the request of the author. These activities are
		funded by NSF DBI 0743720: &quot;A Digital Repository for Preservation and
		Sharing of Data Underlying Published Works in Evolutionary Biology.&quot;

		TreeBASE currently makes use of <a

		title="uBio's taxonomic name services">uBio's taxonomic name services</a>
		to match taxon labels in submitted trees and matrices against uBio's dictionary
		of nomenclature. TreeBASE further uses this mapping to acquire and store <a
		href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/taxonomyhome.html/index.cgi?chapter=howlink"
		title="NCBI taxids">NCBI taxids</a>. In prior years, TreeBASE has provided a bulk list 
		of its taxonomy to uBio in order to store links to TreeBASE, and there are plans to 
		automate this procedure in the future.
